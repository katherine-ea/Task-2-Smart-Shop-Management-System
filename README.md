# Task-2-Smart-Shop-Management-System
Programming 2 Task 2 Group Project

Within our code, we have created a shopping management system that shows a GUI which allows users to add, delete and manage stock. It consists of five pages, the first of which is the homepage, which contains 4 buttons to guide users throughout the GUI. Within one of the buttons, it will take the user to a report screen with a graph of the sales of products. Another screen allows the user to add products to the system and gives the product a price and quantity. Another button shows an overview of the sales, allowing the user to purchase a product and increasing sales data. Finally, there is an inventory screen which brings all product data onto one screen so users can have an overview of what they have left in stock.
